Problem Statement

Given an image as a 2-D character array or a string [], scale it up by factor. That is, if the original image is M x N, the scaled image should be (M*factor) x (N*factor). Each character in the input should be represented by factor x factor of the same character in the output (see examples).

 

Constraints

- Range of M and N will be between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.

- Each character in image will have ASCII value between 32 and 126, inclusive.

- Factor will be between 0 and 50, inclusive.

- The output will contain at most 7500 characters.

 

Input and Output Format:

The first line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to M.

The second line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to N.

The next M lines of the input corresponds to the image.

The last line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to the factor.

 

Output consists of the scaled up image.

Refer sample output for formatting specifications.

 

Sample Input:

3

3

abc

def

ghi

3

 

Sample Output:

aaabbbccc

aaabbbccc

aaabbbccc

dddeeefff

dddeeefff

dddeeefff

ggghhhiii

ggghhhiii

ggghhhiii
